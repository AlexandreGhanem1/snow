        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Project Overview: Snow Covered Areas</h1>
        <section className="space-y-6">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Introduction</h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">The "Snow Covered Areas" project represents a groundbreaking fusion of environmental science and advanced technology, focusing on the meticulous mapping and predictive analysis of snow coverage. Originating with a dedicated application for Lebanon, our endeavor has ambitiously expanded to encompass the diverse and challenging landscapes of France. Our goal is clear: to devise a sophisticated system capable of precise snow cover mapping and forecasting, serving as an indispensable tool in the realm of environmental monitoring and climate change studies.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Significance</h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">Understanding the dynamics of snow coverage is crucial for a multitude of applications—ranging from water resource management and climate change research to disaster prevention strategies. By delivering precise, real-time data on snow cover, our project stands to significantly benefit scientific research, policy formulation, and academic pursuits. The breadth of application spans critical domains such as hydrology, meteorology, and environmental conservation, highlighting the project’s far-reaching impact and relevance.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Target Audience</h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">The primary beneficiaries of our project include environmental scientists, climate researchers, policymakers, and organizations actively involved in environmental conservation and climate change mitigation.
